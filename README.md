# chuk-mcp-training

MCP-controlled remote training harness for Colab and rented single GPUs.
Spec: `docs/specs/chuk-mcp-training-spec.md` (v0.7) · status + plan: `ROADMAP.md`.

Milestones **M0–M2** are built; the control plane is deployed on Fly
(`chuk-mcp-training.fly.dev`), **stateless on Neon** (serverless Postgres), with
checkpoints in Cloudflare R2 and cold storage on Google Drive. Proven on real
hardware: **E0** (agent joins a Colab T4, `nvidia-smi` + matmul probe, live logs)
and **E1** (a 115M-param model trains on the T4, metrics stream, lineage-complete
checkpoints upload directly to R2, and the resume test passes — bounce the Colab
cell mid-run and it resumes from the R2 checkpoint). **M2** (leases, drain,
provider-verified destroy, reconcile / orphan-kill, ledger) is verified locally
via a mock provider; live Vast E2 pending.

Beyond the milestones, the harness now has a **full Google-authed operator
dashboard** (a clean per-run view — live loss + metric toggles, streamed logs,
checkpoints with metadata + download, events, out-links — plus fleet/runs filters
and pagination); a complete **Drive cold-archive tier** (completed runs auto-tier
their final checkpoint + logs to Drive, R2 lifecycle expires the hot copies,
retrieval resolves R2 *or* Drive, with `archive_run`/`archive_runs`/`archive_status`
MCP tools); and **RBAC** — users + roles (sysadmin › admin › write › read) in a
team, with **self-service scoped MCP API keys** (any signed-in user mints their
own ≤ their role; admins manage the team); and an **optional
chuk-experiments-server reporting mirror** (gated off by default — when
configured, run lifecycle + checkpoints-as-artifacts + final-metrics-as-results
mirror into the experiments registry, best-effort). Next M-work: M4 budget caps +
watchdogs, then M3 packing. See `ROADMAP.md`.

**Runs standalone.** Every external tier is gated and optional — no R2 (falls
back to `file:`), no Drive (archive tier off), no Google auth (API-token box),
and no chuk-experiments-server (reporting mirror off). The harness's own Neon/
SQLite store + queue are always the source of truth; nothing outside is a hard
dependency.

**chuk-compute substrate (in progress).** Underneath the training-first control
plane the rig is being factored into a **compute fabric**: a permanently
compute-generic worker + wire protocol. **M1 is done** — the worker
(`chuk-compute-worker`) is a domain-free executor that runs generic *jobs*
(stage inputs → command → outputs) and speaks `chuk-compute-wire`; the control
plane translates a run into a generic job and interprets the results back into
checkpoints. Same behaviour as before (proven — including the E1 resume/slice
path), now on a substrate that will grow to run evals, benchmarks, cells, agents,
and RL loops. Spec: `docs/specs/chuk-compute-spec.md`.

**Stack:** Rust control plane + Rust worker (`chuk-compute-worker`); the MCP tool
surface is Python on `chuk-mcp-server`, a thin client over the control plane's
REST API. House rules: async native, no magic strings, no magic numbers, pydantic
native on the Python side, clean/decoupled modules, ≥90% test coverage per file.
The worker↔control-plane protocol lives in `chuk-compute-wire` (generic, serde-
only); training domain types + constants live in `chuk-train-proto` (Rust,
control-plane side) and are mirrored in `chuk_train_mcp/constants.py` (Python).

## Layout

- `crates/chuk-compute-wire` — the compute-generic worker↔control-plane protocol
  (chuk-compute-spec): the `Hello` handshake, the generic `Job` model (inputs →
  command → outputs, batch-vs-service), capabilities, worker classes, telemetry
  config, and the blob-transfer contract. Serde-only, no domain vocabulary (a
  lexical guard enforces it). The worker depends on nothing else in the workspace.
- `crates/chuk-train-proto` — control-plane domain types, constants, and the
  store key layout (run/train/checkpoint specs, RBAC types, REST payloads). The
  source of truth for the training domain + the CP↔MCP REST surface.
- `crates/chuk-train-cp` — control plane daemon (axum + tokio + sqlx):
  `/ws/agent` (worker websocket), `/api/*` (role-authed REST + grant-auth
  upload/fetch), `/` (the operator dashboard), `/healthz`. Adapter seams — the
  metadata store (`postgres:`/`postgresql:` → Neon, or `sqlite:path.db` local),
  the artifact blob store (`r2:`/`s3:`, or `file:/path`), and the provider
  registry (`mock`, `vast` skeleton). Modules include `store` (SQLite + Postgres
  adapters), `archive` (Drive tiering + backstop sweep), `drive` (Drive v3
  client), `apikey` (RBAC keys + bearer→role resolution), and `dash` (the
  dashboard). Builds code units, mints run-scoped upload grants, ingests metrics
  + checkpoints, resumes, auto-archives completed runs, and runs the lease clock
  + reconcile loop that enforce the wall and kill orphans.
- `crates/chuk-compute-worker` — the join-anywhere worker binary (depends only on
  `chuk-compute-wire`): dials out, `Hello` handshake, heartbeats, and runs generic
  jobs — stages inputs (fetch/unpack into a sandbox), runs the command under
  supervision, streams logs/metrics, collects outputs (uploaded as artifacts),
  reconnects with backoff. Domain-free: the training-ness (code units, resume,
  checkpoint lineage) is expressed by the control plane in the job it sends.
  Builds to a static musl binary workers download.
- `mcp/` — `chuk-train-mcp` Python package: `fleet`, `submit_shell`, `list_runs`,
  `run_status`, `tail_logs`, `run_events`, `build_code_unit`, `submit_run`,
  `run_metrics`, `list_checkpoints`, `pin_checkpoint`, `artifact_url`,
  `provider_offers`, `provision`, `spend_status`, `colab_cell`, and the archive
  tools `archive_run`, `archive_runs`, `archive_status`.
- `examples/stub-trainer/` — a contract-honouring stub trainer code unit (the E1
  fixture + demo trainer): reads `$CHUK_CONFIG`, emits rich metrics
  (loss/lr/grad_norm/tokens_per_s/tflops) + logs, writes checkpoints, resumes.
- `scripts/demo.sh` — one-command local demo: a CP + mock workers running the
  stub-trainer so the dashboard fills with live data (isolated from prod).
- `scripts/authorize-drive.py` — one-time `drive.file` offline auth → refresh token.
- `bootstrap/colab_cell.py` — the one Colab cell that joins a T4 as a worker (E0).
- `deploy/` — Dockerfile + fly.toml (`auto_stop_machines = "off"`); stateless on
  Neon (the store URL is a Fly secret; the `/data` volume is legacy).

## Run locally

```bash
export CHUK_TRAIN_API_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 24)
export CHUK_TRAIN_JOIN_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 24)

cargo run -p chuk-train-cp                                   # control plane :8700
cargo run -p chuk-compute-worker -- \
  --url ws://127.0.0.1:8700/ws/agent --token $CHUK_TRAIN_JOIN_TOKEN

cd mcp && uv sync && CHUK_TRAIN_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8700 \
  uv run chuk-train-mcp                                      # MCP (stdio)
```

Or the one-command demo (mock workers running the stub-trainer, so the dashboard
fills with live runs):

```bash
./scripts/demo.sh          # then open http://127.0.0.1:8700 ; Ctrl-C to stop
```

Dashboard: <http://127.0.0.1:8700/> — Google sign-in when configured, else the
API-token box (local dev). Set `CHUK_TRAIN_STORE=postgresql://…` (Neon's pooled
endpoint) to run against Postgres instead of local SQLite.

## First real run: Colab (E0)

Colab is the proving backend (spec §14) — units already paid for, no rental.
Full runbook: **[docs/E0-colab.md](docs/E0-colab.md)**. In short:

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy --copy-config -c deploy/fly.toml
fly volumes create chuk_train_data --size 1 -c deploy/fly.toml
fly secrets set -c deploy/fly.toml CHUK_TRAIN_API_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 24) \
                                   CHUK_TRAIN_JOIN_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 24)
fly deploy -c deploy/fly.toml --dockerfile deploy/Dockerfile
```

The Fly image builds both binaries and the **control plane serves the worker per
target** at `/agent/{triple}` (+ `.sha256`), with a one-shot **`/install.sh`** that
detects the box's target, downloads + checksum-verifies the matching worker, and
joins — so the Colab cell needs only the Fly URL + join token. Fill those into
`bootstrap/colab_cell.py` (a one-line `curl … | sh` over `/install.sh`), paste it
into a T4 notebook, and the worker appears in `fleet`. Submit the E0 probe
(`nvidia-smi` + a matmul throughput run) with `submit_shell` and watch it stream
via `tail_logs`.

## Train a run (E1)

```bash
# Build a code unit from a repo/commit (or a local path, as here) …
build_code_unit(repo="examples/stub-trainer", name="stub-trainer")   # → code sha
# … then queue a train run against it.
submit_run(name="e1", code_name="stub-trainer", code_sha="<sha>",
           entrypoint="train", config="configs/stub.json", seed=81)
```

Checkpoints upload to the artifact store with lineage-complete `meta.json`
(code, config hash, tokenizer hash, parent, run id, seed, slices). Kill the
worker mid-run and the control plane requeues it; a fresh worker resumes from
the last uploaded checkpoint and the slice list records both halves. Follow it
with `run_metrics`, `list_checkpoints`, and `run_events`; pull a checkpoint to
the Mac with `artifact_url`.

## The script contract (spec §5.1)

A train entrypoint reads a handful of env vars — about five lines to adopt:

| var | meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `$CHUK_CONFIG` | absolute path to the resolved config file |
| `$CHUK_OVERRIDES` | JSON object of config overrides |
| `$CHUK_METRICS` | append one JSON object per line (step + numeric fields) |
| `$CHUK_CKPT_DIR` | write `step_<n>/` dirs; `touch step_<n>/.ready` when complete |
| `$CHUK_RESUME_CKPT` | a checkpoint dir to resume from (empty on a fresh run) |
| `$CHUK_RUN_ID`, `$CHUK_SEED` | provenance |

See `examples/stub-trainer/train.py` for a minimal working example.

## Leases + cleanup (E2)

```bash
# Provision a leased worker (mock launches a real agent process locally) …
provider_offers(provider="mock")
provision(provider="mock", lease_min=15, gpu="mock-t4", max_price_hr=0.10)
# … it runs jobs until the wall. extend_lease is the only path past it.
```

A lease is a hard wall (spec §3). At T-drain the control plane sends the agent
`drain` (and the agent self-drains on its own clock if the CP is dark); at T-0
it destroys the provider instance and **verifies it is gone by polling the
provider API — whether or not the agent ever responded**. A reconcile loop
lists real instances every interval and auto-kills any the registry does not
own (a hung agent, a dead tunnel, a wedged box). An idle reaper drains and
destroys a worker sitting idle past its threshold. Every lease and teardown
writes a cost record; `spend_status` reads the ledger.

Local E2 uses the `mock` provider, which launches the agent binary as real
processes, so provider-verified destroy is genuinely real (the OS process is
provably gone) — including the `kill -STOP` hung-agent case. The `vast` driver
is written to the same trait; a real 15-minute Vast lease is the live E2 test.

Set `CHUK_TRAIN_PROVIDERS`, `CHUK_TRAIN_AGENT_BIN` (mock), `CHUK_TRAIN_VAST_API_KEY`
(vast). `CHUK_TRAIN_RECONCILE_S`, `CHUK_TRAIN_IDLE_REAP_S`, and
`CHUK_TRAIN_DRAIN_WINDOW_MIN` override timings for fast local runs.

## Dashboard, access & archive

The operator dashboard (`/`, spec §9) is served by the control plane and gated
behind **Google sign-in** (session cookie; the API-token box is the local-dev
fallback). It has an overview (fleet/runs/spend/health with filters + pagination)
and a per-run view: live loss curve + metric toggles, streamed logs, config,
checkpoints with full metadata + download, events, and out-links (W&B /
experiments-server). Runs get sortable `RUN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-NNNNN` ids (a
store-backed 5-digit sequence, the same shape chuk-experiments-server mints).

**Access (RBAC):** users have a role — sysadmin › admin › write › read — in a
team (single default team; multi-team scaffolded). `read`/`write`/`admin` mirror
chuk-experiments-server; `sysadmin` is the extra platform-owner tier (the legacy
master token resolves to it). The **Access** screen is **self-service**: any
signed-in user mints, lists, and revokes **their own** MCP API keys, always
scoped **at or below their own role** (shown once, hashed at rest). Admins
additionally manage team members and see every key in the team. Roles are
enforced per endpoint: read = view, write = submit/manage runs, admin = archive +
manage access. Give MCP clients a scoped key (`CHUK_TRAIN_API_TOKEN=ck_…`) instead
of the master token.

**Archive tier (spec §11.5):** Drive is the durable, browsable home; R2 is a hot
cache. When a run completes, its final checkpoint + logs + metrics tier to Google
Drive automatically (a background loop is both the prompt archiver and the
idempotent backstop); the final is promoted to `ckpt-final/` on R2, and R2
lifecycle expires the hot copies (`ckpt-hot/` 1d, `ckpt-final/` 30d). A stable
per-checkpoint URL resolves R2-or-Drive. Trigger/inspect via `archive_run`,
`archive_runs`, `archive_status`. (R2 lifecycle needs an Admin R/W token, or set
the two rules in the Cloudflare R2 dashboard.)

## Current limits (deliberate — see spec §14)

No packing or budgets/caps yet; one run in flight per worker; logs/metrics are
dropped while the control plane is dark. A dropped train run resumes from its
last uploaded checkpoint; a dropped shell run restarts. M3 adds the packing
scheduler; M4 adds budget caps + watchdog gates (the dashboard is done).
